# Project UCW-portfolio  
# **Remote Work Analysis and Optimization Framework**

## **Overview**
This project is designed to analyze and optimize remote work practices by leveraging AWS cloud infrastructure and data engineering methodologies. It focuses on three critical aspects:
1. **Employee Eligibility**: Who qualifies for remote work?
2. **Performance Tracking**: How does remote work impact productivity?
3. **Resource Allocation**: Is equipment distribution aligned with employee needs?

The framework ensures data-driven decision-making to improve productivity, resource allocation, and policy compliance.

## **Architecture**
### **Key Components**
- **Data Sources**:
  - **General Virtual Servers**: Employee eligibility and performance clickstream logs.
  - **Web Virtual Servers**: Resource allocation and security compliance data.
- **AWS Infrastructure**:
  - **S3 Buckets**: Stores raw, cleaned, and transformed datasets.
  - **AWS Glue**: Manages ETL workflows for data processing.
  - **CloudWatch**: Provides observability for monitoring pipeline health and logs.
  - **EFS**: Shared storage for HR resources and logs.
- **Security**:
  - **IAM Roles**: Role-based access control.
  - **Data Encryption**: Ensures data safety at rest and in transit.

## **Datasets**
1. **Employee Eligibility Data**:
   - Fields: Employee IDs, eligibility status, departments, and roles.
2. **Performance Tracking Data**:
   - Fields: Work hours, productivity scores, login frequency, and feedback ratings.
3. **Resource Allocation Data**:
   - Fields: Equipment provided, reimbursable expenses, and security compliance metrics.

## **Methodology**
1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Collect raw data from virtual servers and store it in Amazon S3 buckets.
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Standardize data using AWS Glue DataBrew (e.g., column naming, null value handling).
3. **ETL**:
   - Transform datasets into enriched outputs with AWS Glue pipelines.
4. **Governance, protection, and observability**:
   - Enforce role-based access control, encryption, Privacy & Quality Check, and observability.
5. **Analysis**:
   - Generate insights on eligibility, productivity, and resource allocation.
